This project is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, pause, reset the stopwatch, and record lap times. The stopwatch features a dynamic user interface with a digital display for minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and it provides a list to keep track of recorded lap times.
